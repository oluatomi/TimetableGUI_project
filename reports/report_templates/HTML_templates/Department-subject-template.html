            Each of the created departments is rendered, showing all of its constituent subjects (whether regular or <em>In-parallel</em>) as well relevant details about each of said subject's resident teachers.<br>
            Details like the teachers ID, designation, consistency (Part-time or Full-time), what arm (or arms) the teacher takes (on what day and during what periods), are disclosed to ensure that the user gets a precise understanding of all the nuances that each department presents.
