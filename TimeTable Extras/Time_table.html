    <h4 class="topic">INTRODUCING THE SOFTWARE</h4>

<h4 class=".sub-topic">Quick heads-up</h4>
<p>Hello reader. The purpose of this manual is to get you acquainted with the terms and processes involved in the use of this app. Indeed, these processes are not complicated, they just might require a little bit of getting used to, as some of the terms (with which we probably have already been familiar) have been redefined. The redefined terms have undergone no radical change in definition, rest assured, they just have been tweaked in a few places for the purpose of the app. By and large, they still retain their conventional, outside-this-app meanings.</p>
<!-- <h4 class="sub-topic">Statement of the problem</h4>
<p>The rigour of fashioning a timetable for a large school with so many areas of compartmentalization could be, among other things, overwhelming. Teachers usually take on more than one subject and are required to fulfil the weekly quota of each subject they take, in all the classes (or class arms, should such exist) for which those subjects exist.</p>

<p>The timetable is thus constructed such that for all the periods available for each arm of each class for a single day, each teacher's teaching periods do not overlap for every subject and every class that they teach, so they would not be required to be in two places at the same time.</p>

<p>Setting up the timetable, more often than not, becomes very complicated very quickly as other requirements (double periods being one of many) often get thrown into the mix. The larger the school, the larger the teaching staff to pass subjects around, or the larger the number of subjects, the more complicated the problem tends to prove, especially when adjustments are required on the fly.
The launch of such a task presents itself as hectic, and would require a lot of permutation.
This exactly is the challenge this software undertakes. by abstracting away all the rigmarole and rendering the results in an effective, workable format.</p> -->

DEFINITION OF TERMS

</style>
<h4 style="color:#0080c0;">THE MEANING OF TERMS AS USED IN THIS APP</h4>
<p>There exists the likelihood that some of the terms are used in this application might be a little confusing to new users. These terms are thus defined:</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Day (as in School day).</h4>
    <p>Day, as used in this app, does not necessarily refer to its dawn-till-dusk meaning. It simply refers to the time frame (usually a day, hence the name) within which all the periods for a certain class feature. It spans the first and last periods of school for an (actual) entire day in real-life. For a typical school in South-Western Nigeria (where this app was initially written), the school day starts by 8:00 a.m. and runs till 2:00 p.m. unless there are arangements for afternoon classes. It is the first period all the way till the last.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Department:</h4>
    <p>The Department, much like its real-life meaning, is a container for the subjects provided by a school to its students. It is a catalogue for organizing subjects which share some level of decided-upon similarity.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Subject/Course</h4>
    <p>
    Subject (also, Course), as with "Day" above, may not always refer to the conventional meaning of the word in an academic setting, though it does, more often than not. A subject (course), with regard to the timetable, is any engagement which occupies one or more periods of a given class arm. 
    Subjects occupy whole number values of periods e.g Music in the first period or Math in the first two periods. Two subjects can only exist for the same period(s) if they go concurrently and both run through till the end of the period, e.g Yoruba/Igbo languages occupy the last period.
    Subjects do not always have to be academic; break-period (recess) or extracurriculars also count as subjects inasmuch as they fall within "Day". A subject is termed academic if it is handled by a teacher. Non-academic periods are termed "Special periods".</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Period:</h4>
    <p>
    A period is the set duration within which a subject occurs. 
    How long it takes is institution-specified. It is the very measure by which "Day" is calibrated.
    Academic periods tend to have the same period duration, whereas, special periods might take varying lengths.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>School Class Category:</h4>
    <p>
    Also termed "class category" or "class group", this is simply a collection of all the classes across different levels or grades with a common property for ease of reference. This in real life is what we would call "Senior School", or "Junior High" in a school situation especially where more than one school class category might exist. For instance, the typical Nigerian secondary school has two class categories: Junior secondary school and Senior secondary school.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>School Class (or simply, Class):</h4>
    <p>
    The school class is a combination of all the arms that share one level of the academic hierarchy in the school setting. In the typical Nigerian school system, its arms are prefixed with the its name and alphabetized, e.g. JSS 1A, SSS 2B. This App can also render each arm of class in question numerically, e.g, JSS 1_1, SSS2_2
    </p>
</li>

<li><h4>School Class Arm:</h4>
    <p>
    Sometimes, plainly referred to as "Arms", the school class arm is a sub-section of the school class, which in turn is a subset of the school class category. The arm is the compartment into which the school class divided, primarily to accommodate a number of students that exceeds the standard number of students studying together in the same class room and to allow for different specialisations between students of the same class, e.g. Sciences and The Arts. The school class arm is the literal classroom in which schoolwork is done.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Teacher:</h4>
    <p>Fairly self-explanatory. A teacher handles the subject for a class at a given "Period" of the "Day". It is quite possible for a teacher to take on more than one subject, across more than one class arm.</p>
</li>

TAB-TOPIC 3:
MODEL STRUCTURE
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<p>This application models the operational structure of a full-fledged (typical Nigerian) school. However, this model structure is in no way limited to schools with such an operational structure. It can be modified to suit schools whose structures are not as involved.
As earlier stated, this application models both the school's operational structure and the (likely) interactions between them. These models present themselves in hierarchical formats.</p>
<p>There are two models, conveniently termed <strong>The Class-hierarchy</strong> and <strong>The Course-hierarchy</strong>. 
At its core, the timetable, in this context, is little more than a black and white representation of the relationship between subjects(courses) and classrooms at certains parts of the day, both collectively (i.e in whatever groups these might have been sorted into) and individually.
Both models would have to be created.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4>The Class-hierarchy</h4>
<p>The class hierarchy represents the superset-set-subset relationship of the between the items in the class hierarchy.</p>
<p>The hierarchy can be simply represented as:</p>
<span class="tree">Class group > Class > Class arm</span>
<p>Class groups contain all the classes which in turn contain all the arms for said classes.
The class category in the real-life school setting is what we would call 'Junior School' or 'Senior High' or 'middle School' (US). It is merely a convenient way to categorize classes, especially in a setting that more than one class category running.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>The Course hierarchy</h4>
<p>The Course hierarchy, just like the class hierarchy above, is a superset-set-subset relationship that describes the key components of the structure that handles and executes teaching, course structure and the various instances of specializations of class arms within a class, e.g class arms designated for The Arts or Sciences or other.</p>
<p>The teachers primarily handle the teaching and what they teach is the subject or course. The department is merely the container that houses like subjects, a neat way of grouping subjects in the event that similar-structured subjects are taken as a whole.
However, for ease of design (as regards the efficiency of coding), among other things, the subject is said to "have" a teacher and "hail from" a department.</p>
<p>It should be plainly stated that there are certain subjects (special subjects, as they are referred to here, as discussed in the definition of terms section) which do not require handling by a teacher. These are subjects like break-time (recess) or extracurricular activities.
(The definition of the term <strong>subject</strong> used here and throughout the manual is consistent with the definition -- or redefinition, If you will -- in the Definition of terms section).</p>

<p>The Course hierarchy goes:</p>
<span class="tree">Department > Subject/Course > Teacher</span>

<p>Or, as is the case of a special subject:</p>
<span class="tree">Department > Special Subject/Course</span>
<p>No teacher involved.</p>
</li>

</ol>

TAB-TOPIC:
THE TEACHER MODEL DYNAMICS

<html>
<p>Apparently, the Teacher model (in the app), is  an "in binary" rendering of  the Teacher, who, much more often than not, is an actual human.
There exist some intricacies with regard to the teacher model that cannot be ignored.</p>
One of these is that:
<ul>
    <li><h4>The Teacher's teaching periods must not overlap.</h4>
        <p>This is a major challenge in the setup of any timetable. Teachers (might) teach across different classes for a particular day in which they teach. There should be no intersection whatsoever between in the teacher's sequence. Otherwise, that would imply that the teacher is required to be in two places at the same time.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>And that:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>It could be the case that some of the teaching staff might be required to be "off work " on certain days of the week.</h4>
    <p>This is especially true for the National Youth Service Corps Members (A Nigerian one-year assignment programme for tertiary institution graduates especially for those under thirty) who during their term of service often teach in schools. They are required by the programme to gather on a certain day to effect their community-development strategies, and as such do not attend school on that day.
    Indeed this is just one use-case. However, the possibility that teachers (belonging to a peculiar group) for some reason, would be absent on a certain day or days is plausible.</p>
    <p>This application puts that factor into consideration.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
